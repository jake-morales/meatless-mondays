## Cloud Provider Choice

For my project, here are my needs:
- Host my html/css/js
- Serverless function to handle submissions and call Google Drive APIs

For my use case, Netlify was the easiest, simplest, least boiler plate option. I considered GCP and Firebase, but there was too much set up involved.
